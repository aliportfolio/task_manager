# Task Manager

Simple web application that allow you to Manage your tasks with filter (with Mysql database).

**Important Note:**

Task is completed, but time didn't help me use all advanced features (improvements),
but i used some of (PHP / Laravel) features:
- Requests to validation.
- Traits.
- Migrations & Seeders.
- Simple relation in models.
- Vue js Front end with files structure.
- SPA (single page application).
- Handling Response with success and error messages dynamically.


**Some advanced features i wanted to implement if I had the time:**
- BaseApiController (I wrote the structure in: App\Http\Controllers\Api\BaseApiController.php)
- (Services / Repositories) Pattern.
- Handling Response with advanced way (i wrote the structure in files: App\Common\SharedMessages.php and App\Traits\Api\V1\AdvancedApiResponse.php).
- Define config file in vue js to store token and request Headers.
- Unit Testing.
